# Music-Visualizer

An audio visualizer that takes frequencies from an mp3 file and displays them in the form of oscillating bars based on the frequencies! Currently written in vanilla JS/HTML/CSS.

You may replace track.mp3 with your own mp3 file of the same format to visualize your chosen song. The default song I chose is "Wife and Two Dogs" by Quinn XCII if you were wondering :)

## How to run:
To run on your computer, cd into Music-Visualizer in your terminal and enter in " node_modules/.bin/http-server -p 8083 ", then click on one of the port links generated in your terminal. The track should start playing immediately.

#### Important note: 
You may need to enable autoplay and/or sound in your browser if the track doesn't play automatically. Settings may differ between browsers. In Brave Browser:

    1) Click on the icon to the left of the URL\

    2) Go to site settings 
    
    3) Under permissions, enable sound and autoplay (Non-default)
